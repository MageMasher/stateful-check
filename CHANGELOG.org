* 0.3.0

- *breaking* add ~next-state~ to the ~:real/postcondition~ function
  arguments in commands

  Any command preconditions will need to be modified to take an extra
  argument
  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (fn [state args result]
      arbitrary-logic-for-postcondition)
    ;; needs to change to
    (fn [prev-state next-state args result]
      arbitrary-logic-for-postcondition)
  #+END_SRC

- *breaking* change `reality-matches-model?` to be called
  `reality-matches-model` (it's not a predicate, so it shouldn't have
  a `?` in its name)

- make the command generator use the same size for all commands

* 0.2.0

- add namespaces to some keys which didn't have them before
  - ~:generate-command~ is now ~:model/generate-command~
  - ~:setup~ is now ~:real/setup~
  - ~:cleanup~ is now ~:real/cleanup~

- add some more keys to the top-level spec object:
  - ~:model/initial-state~, ~:real/initial-state~, ~:initial-state~
    for setting the initial state of the system
  - ~:real/postcondition~ on the top-level spec, to check for global
    invariants

- make symbolic values implement ~ILookup~ (to work with ~get~)

- clean up exception handling during command runs

* 0.1.0

Initial release.
